Vue JS Essentials with Vuex and Vue Router course

Steven Grider course exploring Vue JS.

Vue HTML Templates (DOM)
Vue JS Instances

JS Instance:
Element - refers to template element by id
Method - defines functions, named in html
Directive - template syntax inside of Vue

Imperative vs Declarative

Imperative process:
step by step directions : recipe
1 Detect user input
2 Get input text
3 Use text to do something
4 Show the result

Declarative process:
initial state (variables)
rules that are tested and processed

1 initial state or 'data'
Rules (with properties)
2 if user enters text, updates data (methods or functions)
3 if template is rendered, consumes data (computed property)
4 if input is updated, rerender the template (automatic result)

Vue API
Data -> defines the 'initial state' of our Vue instance
Methods -> defines the different ways our state can change
Computed -> defines how to turn the current data into viewable results

Data -> how everything starts
Methods -> changes data
Computed -> turns data into viewable stuff
